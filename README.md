# Exploration-on-Ford-GoBike-Data-System
This project consists on exploratory and explanatory analysis of a dataset on the bike-rental service Ford GoBike in the San Francisco Bay area. 
The dataset contains information on 183412 bike trips carried out during the month of february in the year 2019.
There are two parts in this proyect: 
- The first part is the exploratory analysis of the dataset, where the assesing and cleaning take place and also a bigger number of visualizations to extract information on the dataset
- The second part is the explanatory analysis of the dataset, where the most important findings which took place on the exporatory part are exposed with higher quality visualizations.
  
This is my third proyect as part of the Udacity course "Data Analyst".
